# AI-Powered Crop Yield Prediction and Optimization ðŸŒ¾

This project predicts crop yields using ML models trained on historical agricultural data, weather, and soil health.  
It also provides **optimization recommendations** for irrigation, fertilization, and pest control to help farmers improve productivity.  

## Features
- Crop yield prediction based on multiple inputs
- Historical data comparison
- Optimization and actionable recommendations
- Scalable design for web/mobile integration

## Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
- APIs for weather & soil data
- Optional: Streamlit/Flask for user interface

## Setup
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd crop-yield-ml
pip install -r requirements.txt
